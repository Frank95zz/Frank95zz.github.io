I am an incoming PhD student (starting in September, 2026) at Shanghai Jiaotong University, affiliated with IWIN-FINS Lab, advised by Prof. Jianping He. I am interested in perception, navigation and control of underwater robots recently.

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majoring in Automation (Academic Elite Program). During my undergraduate studies, I received multiple honors and awards, including the National Scholarship for twice, 2024 MCM Finalist, and several national- and provincial- awards.
