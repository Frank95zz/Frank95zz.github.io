I am an incoming PhD student (starting in September, 2026) at Shanghai Jiaotong University, affiliated with [IWIN-FINS Lab](https://iwin-fins.com/), advised by [Prof. Jianping He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=uMFWYBoAAAAJ). I am interested in perception, navigation and control of underwater robots recently.

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majoring in Automation ([Academic Elite Program](http://www.ef.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1019/7971.htm)). During my undergraduate studies, I received multiple honors and awards, including the National Scholarship for twice, 2024 MCM Finalist, and several national- and provincial- awards.
